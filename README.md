ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!
I'm Rahul Chaube (he/him), a passionate CSE student, full-time open-source contributor, and founder of multiple projects blending AI, creativity, and technology. I'm currently working on ominiR â€“ a vision to create the worldâ€™s most powerful and accessible open-source 

I believe in the core values of open-source collaboration, building in public, and using tech for social impact. From competing in top hackathons like ICPC, HackAI by Nvidia, and Red Bull Basement, to building platforms like Flick (AI learning), AgroSathi, and CampusConnect, I'm on a mission to make tech smarter and more human.

ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus:
ðŸ”¸ ominiR â€“ building the best open-source M with cutting-edge features
ðŸ”¸ Creating voice-driven AI assistants & intelligent apps
ðŸ”¸ Educating and helping students through AI-powered tools


If you're excited by the future of AI, voice assistants, LLMs, and powerful student-built tech, consider sponsoring my work. Your support helps me afford GPUs, hosting, and dedicate more time to making these tools better for everyone.


Let's build the future, together ðŸš€
â†’ Support. Sponsor. Inspire.
